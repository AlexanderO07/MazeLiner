# MazeLiner
The Python project code generates a maze using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.      It prompts the user to enter the height and width of the maze, validates the input, and then      generates a random maze with paths and walls, allowing for customizable dimensions, and provides a visual representation of the maze on the console.
